# Pastel frontend assessment

You'll be using this repository which comes pre-configured with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Tailwind as the basis for your assessment project. 

## Getting started

To start, make a private clone of this repo under your own account, and then clone the repo to your local computer. You'll need Node.js installed in order to run the project. Navigate to that repo and then run:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) with your browser to see the result.

Now you can start editing the page by modifying `pages/login.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You'll be working with one pre-created [API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) for powering the login page that can be accessed by POST-ing to [http://localhost:3000/api/sessions](http://localhost:3000/api/sessions). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/sessions.ts`.

## What to build

For this project, you'll be building a login page. You'll use Tailwind and React to build out the login page designs which are linked here [TODO: Link Figma login page design]. Next, you'll connect the login form to the login API endpoint.

You should handle all errors as well as the successful login use case.

We encourage you to email us with any questions/concerns/blockers/thoughts that you may encounter during the course of this project.
